			<h2>Make a Card Set Public</h2>
			<p>Do you really like your sets of flashcards and think others could really benefit from them? Make a request to release them publicly so that everyone can see them and benefit! Pending a quick review to make sure we protect our younger users, your cards will soon be made available for everyone!</p>
